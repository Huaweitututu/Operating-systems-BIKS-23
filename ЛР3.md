**Command Line Interface (CLI)** - An interface that allows users to interact with the operating system through text commands.

**CPU** - A central processing unit (CPU), also called a central processor, main processor, or just processor, is the primary processor in a given computer.

**Prompt** – The command-line prompt that displays information about the user and system.

**Alias** – A shortcut for a command, allowing long commands to be abbreviated.

**Variable** - A storage unit for values used in Bash.

**External command** – A command stored in a file and executed by the shell.

**Function** – A set of commands that can be executed as a single command.

# Визначення

**Command interpreter** - is a system software that understands and executes commands that are entered interactively by a human or from an another program. 

**Shell** - An interpreter that processes entered commands and passes them to the operating system for execution.

**Command** - are predefined text-based directives for users to convey instructions that trigger the execution of a desired action by the application

# Відповіді на запитання
**1. What basic information does the prompt string provide?**

The prompt string in a terminal provides essential information such as the current user, the hostname of the machine, and the current working directory. It often ends with a symbol (like `$` or `#`) indicating whether the user is a regular user or the superuser (root).

**2. Why do commands need parameters and arguments?**

Commands need parameters and arguments to specify additional information or options that modify their behavior. Parameters are typically options (like `-l` or `--help`) that change how the command operates, while arguments are the inputs or targets the command acts upon (like filenames or directories).

**3. What is the purpose of the `ls` command, what parameters and arguments can it have? Provide 3 examples.**

The `ls` command is used to list files and directories in the current working directory. It can take various parameters and arguments:

- **Parameters:**
  - `-l`: Lists files in long format, showing details like permissions, ownership, size, and modification date.
  - `-a`: Includes hidden files (those starting with a dot `.`) in the listing.
  - `-h`: Displays file sizes in a human-readable format (e.g., KB, MB).

- **Examples:**
  1. `ls -l`: Lists files in long format.
  2. `ls -a`: Lists all files, including hidden ones.
  3. `ls -lh`: Lists files in long format with human-readable file sizes.

**4. How can command history be used, and what advantages does it provide?**

Command history allows users to recall and reuse previously executed commands. This can be done by pressing the `Up` and `Down` arrow keys to navigate through the history or by using the `history` command to display a list of recent commands. The advantages include:

- **Efficiency:** Saves time by reusing complex commands.
- **Accuracy:** Reduces the chance of errors when retyping commands.
- **Learning:** Helps users remember and learn commands over time.

**5. What is the purpose of the `echo` command?**

The `echo` command is used to display a line of text or a variable's value in the terminal. It is commonly used in scripts to output messages or to check the value of variables.

**6. Describe the concept of a variable in the Bash shell, and what types of variables does it support?**

In Bash, a variable is a symbolic name that represents a value stored in memory. Variables can hold different types of data, such as strings, integers, or arrays. Bash supports:

- **Local Variables:** Variables that are only accessible within the current shell session.
- **Environment Variables:** Variables that are inherited by child processes and can affect the behavior of the shell and other programs.
- **Special Variables:** Predefined variables like `$HOME`, `$PATH`, and `$USER` that provide information about the system environment.

**7. What is the purpose of the `env`, `export`, and `unset` commands?**

- **`env`:** Displays all environment variables or runs a command in a modified environment.
- **`export`:** Makes a local variable available to child processes by converting it into an environment variable.
- **`unset`:** Removes a variable or function from the shell environment.

**8. What commands do you know for getting help on commands in the terminal?**

Several commands can be used to get help on commands in the terminal:

- **`man`:** Displays the manual page for a command (e.g., `man ls`).
- **`--help` or `-h`:** Many commands support this option to display a brief help message (e.g., `ls --help`).
- **`info`:** Provides detailed documentation for some commands (e.g., `info ls`).
- **`help`:** A built-in Bash command that provides information about shell built-ins (e.g., `help cd`).
